## DESCRIPTION
This is a code repository for the second project "failure and drug repurposing"

This project examines when pharmaceutical firms adopt a rapid drug development strategy known as drug repurposing, which refers to the redevelopment of the firm's existing drug candidates that are being developed for other diseases.

### What does this repository have?
+ data_cleaning.do
  + STATA do-file for cleaning the data
  + As this project is still under development, only a portion of the code can be shared.

+ technology topography.py
  + python code for generating technology topography using text data
  + Patent text was used

+ comparison_repurpose vs. non_repurpose.py
  + python code for comparing molecular structure of repurposed vs. non-repurposed drug candidates
  + SMILES (molecular structure) was used

### Data used for this project
+ Cortellis (Proprietary data)
